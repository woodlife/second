		<div>In order to do so, we must help them to make right decisions…BUT… firstly…</div>
		<div>
Ireland has 11% of its land covered in trees. This low forest cover is a major contributory factor to our dependance on imported timber from all around the world</div>

		<div>There have been many widely publicised factors behind the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic: the use of live animal markets, government policy to contain the spread once the virus arrived, global air travel, to name a few.
However, one key factor that may also have contributed to the emergence of the virus has been somewhat overlooked – deforestation and the destruction of natural ecosystems.
